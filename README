Defunc
======

Defunc is a tracing module which is plugged into a
class to trace entering, exiting and respective values
to a specified stream.

== Usage

  class Random
    extend Defunc

    def self.random
      5
    end
  end

This scenario will trace a call Random.random() to
standard out and show you the empty argument array []
and the returned value 5.

  class Random
    extend Defunc

    watch_methods :initialize, :random
    set_out_stream File.open("path/to/file", "w")

  end

Defunc offers two methods for class definitions to
control the watched methods (this includes class
and instance methods alike) and the stream it logs
to. set_out_stream accepts any IO instance that has
:puts defined.

The IO instance is class-based and so is watch_methods.
You can extend your super-class (like a base model)
and have all deriving models enable tracing by that.
